# Self-organised criticality in the Oslo Model
Oslo model implementation and analysis (Complexity project)

---

To run a set of simulations, use Oslo.py which saves in /data/ folder by system size (run settings at bottom of file).

Then, use analyseOslo.py for plotting and other analysis (settings at top, scroll to bottom for choosing what to plot).

Both files should be in the same folder, along with logbin.py (credit: Max Falkenberg McGillivray).

Requirements: Standard scientific python libraries (numpy, scipy, pandas etc.) and tqdm
